    My name is Jaylene Beatts. I am 14 years old. I am a freshman in highscool. My school is New Roads. I have three cats, two turtles,
    one dog, and four fish. I like to play soccer, basketball,  and tennis. I have lost my dog a number of times so I thought it would be 
    nice to have a pet finding app. PetFinder serves  as a tool to find lost pets (cats and dogs) and to report found pets.
