      My name is Jaylene Beatts. I am 14 years old. I have three cats and a dog. I have lost my dog a number of times so I thought it would be nice 
			to have a pet finding tool. If you have lost a pet and putting up posters isn't getting the word out past your neighborhood, PetFinder can be 
			used as a virtual poster for found and lost pets.
